Anomaly detection framework using **Martingale-based statistical testing** to detect changes in data streams.  
Supports various **Martingale methods**, including **Power Martingale, Mixture Martingale, SPRT, Multi-View Martingale, and Plugin Martingale**.  
Provides **dynamic p-value computation** and **threshold adjustment** for robust real-time anomaly detection.

---

**Multiple Martingale Approaches** (Power, Mixture, SPRT, Multi-View, Plugin)
-  **Dynamic Threshold Control** based on False Positive Rate (FPR)
-  **p-Value Computation** independent of strangeness measures
-  **Works with Any Strangeness Function** (e.g., k-NN, LOF, SVM, Clustering, Regression)
- **Real-time Processing** for Streaming Data
